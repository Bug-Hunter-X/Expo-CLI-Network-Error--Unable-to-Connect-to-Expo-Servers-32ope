The solution doesn't involve code changes in your project itself, as the issue stems from network connectivity and Expo server communication.  The provided `expoBugSolution.js` file contains steps that need to be executed in your terminal, not code within a JavaScript file.

Steps:
1. `expo diagnostics`
2. Check Expo Status Page
3. Verify network connectivity, proxy settings, firewall configuration.
4. `npm cache clean --force` or `yarn cache clean` (then reinstall expo packages if needed)
5. Reinstall Expo CLI: `npm uninstall -g expo-cli` followed by `npm install -g expo-cli` (or equivalent yarn command)
