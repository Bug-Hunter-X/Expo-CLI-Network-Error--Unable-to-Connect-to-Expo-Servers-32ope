This error typically occurs when the Expo CLI is having trouble communicating with the Expo servers. This can be due to network issues, incorrect configuration, or problems with the Expo servers themselves.  A common symptom is an inability to log in or to install packages.  The exact error message might vary, but usually involves a connection timeout or a similar network-related issue.
